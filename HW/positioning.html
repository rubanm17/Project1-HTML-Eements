        <p id="op">PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a 2017 battle royale video game published by Krafton, and developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. Played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they are tasked to scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever-tightening space to force encounters.

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was first released for Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017; the same month, Microsoft Studios studios released it for the Xbox One via the Xbox Game Preview program, with a full release coming in September 2018. Afterwards the game was ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 consoles, and the Stadia streaming platform, and has also spawned a mobile version, PUBG Mobile, for Android and iOS. The game is continuously developed under the games as a service model and has been free-to-play for all platforms since January 2022.</p>
