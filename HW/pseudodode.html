        <p>Minecraft is a game where the player uses their imagination to shape the world around them using the resources they find. In the world everything is shaped like a block or a cube, this includes the trees, the dirt, the water, the clouds, even the sun, everything. This simple game hasn’t even been released yet but has already sold over one million copies. Minecraft was created by one man, Markus “Notch” Persson, and this is his story. What makes the story of Minecraft so unique is that it was created by Notch and only Notch. Notch had a job before Minecraft, working on games for a company.</p>
        <p>PUBG Mobile is a popular game. Many kids like playing it. It is fun but can be addictive. When you play too much, you may forget to do homework. You may also skip meals or sleep late. This is not good for health. Too much screen time hurts your eyes. Instead, spend time with family or friends. Play outdoor games to stay fit. Playing for a short time is okay, but not for hours. If you get addicted, it’s hard to stop. Parents can help by setting rules. Remember, games are for fun, not for taking over your life.</p>
