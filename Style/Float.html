        <p >What is the periodic table:  
Our world is composed of many things. And these many things are composed of many other things. Everything on our earth is made of the elements of the periodic table (our earth is immense, imagine how important elements are!). Elements are substances that can’t be broken down or made into anything simpler by chemical reactions. The periodic table and its elements are both vital parts of chemistry and other sciences.

The periodic table is basically a table that organizes elements into periods and groups. The vertical groups in the periodic table makeup closely related families of elements. Elements were first put into one giant table in 1869. When the elements were first organized to create what we now know as the …show more content…

This was an object that would supposedly be able to turn metals into pure gold. He heated residues from boiled urine, and a liquid dropped out and burst into flames. This was the discovery of phosphorus. This discovery most definitely had a huge impact on the world of science. In Boyle also discovered phosphorus, and this time it became public. In 1809, at least 47 elements had been found, and scientists had begun to see patterns in the characteristics of elements. In 1863, chemist John Newlands organized the 56 elements into 11 groups based on their characteristics and similarities. In 1869 Dmitri Mendeleev started the creation of the periodic table. He predicted the discovery of more elements, and left spaces open in his periodic table for them. In 1894, Sir William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh discovered the noble gases. The noble gases group was then incorporated into the periodic table. In 1897 physicist J. J. Thomson first discovered electrons; small negatively charged particles in an atom. John Townsend and Robert Millikan later on were able to determine their exact charge and mass.</p>
